## What are protocols exactly?

Internet Protocols, or Network Protocols, are rules and guidelines for sending data between computers connected to the Internet.

They work as a “universal language” between computers, being responsible for collecting the data transmitted over the network and breaking it up into small pieces (“packets”), each carrying source and destination information.

In this section, we will cover many of the most common protocols, from Internet Protocol (IP) to Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3).

### SMTP

> SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol - This is an email protocol used for sending emails from one email account to another via the internet. SMTP server handles the sending, receiving, and relaying of email. You can think of servers as your real-life post offices. When you send a letter from city A to city B, it first reaches a local post office in city A; here, it gets processed and sent to the post office in city B, which is in charge of delivering it to its final destination. The same happens with SMTP servers—though instead of taking days, the process takes a few minutes at most.
