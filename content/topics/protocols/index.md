## Protocols are what exactly?

A protocol is a set of rules and guidelines for communicating data. Rules are defined for each step and process during communication between two or more computers. Here we will cover many of these protocols form IP to POP3.

## SMTP

SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol - This is an email protocol used for sending emails from one email account to another via the internet. SMTP server handles the sending, receiving, and relaying of email. You can think of servers as your real-life post offices. When you send a letter from city A to city B, it first reaches a local post office in city A; here, it gets processed and sent to the post office in city B, which is in charge of delivering it to its final destination. The same happens with SMTP serversâ€”though instead of taking days, the process takes a few minutes at most.

### UDP

>UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. It is specifically chosen for time-sensitive applications like gaming, playing videos, or Domain Name System (DNS) lookups. The UDP skips establishing an connection because it takes time, eliminating this step results in faster data transfer speeds, but due to the process, some of the data packets can get lost in transmission. Using UDP can leave you open to a *[DDoS attack](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/ddos-attack)* if used incorrectly.
